# 🎬 Netflix Clone Landing Page 🎬

This project is a recreation of the Netflix landing page, focusing on replicating the visual design and core user interface elements. It showcases a responsive layout, key features of the Netflix service, and an email signup form to entice new users. It provides a foundation for building a more complete Netflix clone with added functionality.
